# Small Shops - Ecommerce Platform for Small Businesses

## Client is running on [Heroku](https://small-shops-client.herokuapp.com/)

## Important

This product is a proof of concept and isn't ready to be used in production.


## Business idea

This platform is designed to be used by small businesses, which are not willing to invest into their own web store, but would still want to be able to sell products over internet.

The purpose of the platform is to provide an easy and cheap way for stores to get into Ecommerce. With time these stores would gain a large pool of potential customers as people would be able to scroll different types of small businesses on the same site. The motivation for customers would be finding small stores that they would probably never find otherwise.


## Design

The aim was to implement a minimalistic and clear UI, which would emphasize the visual aspect.
